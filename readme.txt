Problem Statment ********************************************************************
You are asked to design a chip cooling scheme that consists of 𝑁 × 𝑁 array of pin fins to be aligned and metallurgically joined to the outer surface of a square chip that is 12.7 mm on a side. An insulated top wall to be placed at the pin tips to force airflow across the pin array. A schematic example of the cooling system consisting of 4 × 4 array of pin fins is shown in the following diagram.
The chip, which is very thin, is joined to a circuit board at its
inner surface. The thermal contact resistance per unit area
-4 2
between the chip and the board is 10 m .K/W, and the board
thickness and thermal conductivity are Lb = 5 mm and kb = 1
W/m.K, respectively. Air enters the array at 20oC with a
velocity V=10 m/s. The pin fin geometry, which includes the
number of pins in the N x N square array, as well as the pin
diameter Dp and length Lp, may be varied. However, the number
of pins multiplied by the diameter of the pins cannot exceed 9 mm. Your design must consider at least three different kinds of materials to be used for the fins. The goal of the design is to maximize the rate of heat removal from the fins while keeping the weight of fins used minimum and satisfying the constraint that temperature of the chip does not exceed 75 oC. Air flow temperature is assumed to remain at 20 oC as it flows over the array of pins. For simplicity,

choose N=12 if your last name starts with a letter between A to C of the alphabet;
choose N=16 if your last name starts with a letter between D to G of the alphabet;
choose N=18 if your last name starts with a letter between H to L of the alphabet;
choose N=20 if your last name starts with a letter between M to P of the alphabet;
choose N=22 if your last name starts with a letter between Q to U of the alphabet;
choose N=24 if your last name starts with a letter between V to Z of the alphabet.

Your design variables are: the fin diameter 𝐷𝑝 (note: 𝑁𝐷𝑝<9 mm), the fin length 𝐿, and fin materials used.
